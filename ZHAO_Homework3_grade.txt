1a) Correct
1b) Correct
1c) Correct
2) Correct
3) Correct
4) Correct
5a) Partially correct. But I did not use the math formula to prove the answer choice.
5b) Incorrect. Forgot my beta_0. :(
5c) Correct
6) Partially correct. It violates the assumption of independence and identically distributed.
7a) Partially correct. I missed that in mixed effects model, v is random. 
7b) Partially correct. I missed another difference between the two objective function: the covariance matrix of the random effect term.
7c) Correct.
8a) Correct.
8b) Correct
8c) Incorrect. I did not correctly include herd as a random effect (did (1|herd) instead of (size|herd))
8d) Incorrect. Did the wrong model in 8c. the AIC is different from the correct answer. 
9ab) Correct.
9c) I'm not sure why my model (which is the same formula) outputted a completely different set of results. I think I changed horsepower to a continuous variable. Maybe that's why? 
9d) Correct.
9e-h) Correct.
10a-j) Correct.
