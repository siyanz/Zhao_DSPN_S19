    "1. Consider the problem of classifying a binary response variable (i.e., $y \\in \\{1,0\\}$). If there is no overlap in the values of X when y = 1 and when y=0,  such that there is a large “gap” between the two distributions of X values, then this is problematic for one of the classifiers discussed in class and the text. What classifier does this situation pose a problem for? Explain conceptually why this is a problem and compare it with another classifier approach that does not suffer this limitation."

    "4. Suppose that we take a data set, divide it into equally-sized training and test sets, and then try out two different classification procedures. First we use logistic regression and get an error rate of 20% on the training data and 30% on the test data. Next we use 1-nearest neighbors (i.e. K = 1) and get an average error rate (averaged over both test and training data sets) of 18%. Based on these results, which method should we prefer to use for classification of new observations? Why?"

    "* For KNN with K=1, the training error rate is 0% because for any training observation, its nearest neighbor will be the response itself. So, that means that KNN has a test error rate of 36%. Thus logistic regression is preferred because of its lower test error rate of only 30%."
